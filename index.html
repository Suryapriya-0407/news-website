                        <div>
                        </div>
                        <p class="mt-3">The move comes after nearly two years since PayPal enabled users to buy and sell
                            crypto on its platform.<br>
                            <img src="images/paypal.jpg" alt=""><br>
                            After rolling out the ability to buy and sell crypto on its platform in October 2020, PayPal
                            is finally allowing users the ability to natively transfer, send and receive digital assets
                            between PayPal and other wallets and exchanges. As of Tuesday, the feature is available to
                            select U.S. users, with the feature expanding to all eligible U.S. users in the coming
                            weeks. The first batch of supported coins consists of Bitcoin
                            BTC $16,704, Ether ETH $1,217, Bitcoin Cash BCH $100, and Litecoin LTC $74.58.
                            Users would simply need to log in to their accounts and enter the crypto section of the
                            application to start transferring coins. Users are generally required to complete a one-time
                            ID verification before the procedure.In addition, customers who transfer their crypto onto
                            PayPal can spend it via Checkout at millions of merchant terminals. The company has been
                            granted a full Bitlicense by the New York Department of Financial Services for the conduct.
                            Crypto transfers to recipients outside of PayPal would incur a network fee based on their
                            respective blockchains, but transfers between PayPal users will not incur such fees. To
                            protect users' privacy, the firm generates a new recipient address for each transaction into
                            one's PayPal account. PayPal will also not charge fees for incoming transfers,
                            The company is also working to integrate other forms of cryptocurrency services, such as
                            central bank digital currencies, to boost its digital footprint. It is also exploring the
                            possibility of launching its own stablecoin, dubbed "PayPal Coin." The discovery came after
                            a developer found evidence of such a stablecoin within the source code of the company's
                            iPhone app.

                        businesses and households facing the energy crisis, Reuters reported.
                        Italy's (and most recently Portugal's) move to introduce a capital-gains tax on crypto comes
                        ahead of the implementation of the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation
                        that promises a licensing frameworks and stringent operating requirements for crypto-service
                        providers in the 27-member bloc.
                        The 26% rate applies to gains from crypto trading if they exceed 2,000 euros per tax period. As
                        an incentive for declaring crypto profits, the new bill also sets a "substitute income tax" for
                        investors at 14% of the value of the assets held as of Jan. 1, 2023, instead of the cost at the
                        time of purchase.
                        According to the new rules, losses from crypto investments can be deducted from profits and be
                        carried forward.
                        Investors, however, may require some additional guidance on what qualifies as a taxable event as
                        the document also says, "the exchange between crypto assets having same characteristics and
                        functions," doesn't constitute a "fiscal case."

                            <p class="mt-3"> Microstrategy is now holding approximately 132,500 bitcoin following its
                                most recent purchases. This year, the world’s largest cryptocurrency has emerged as ‘the
                                institutional-grade digital asset,’ said Microstrategy founder Michael Saylor.

                            <h5>Microstrategy Acquires More Bitcoin</h5>
                            Nasdaq-listed Microstrategy Inc. announced Wednesday that it has purchased more bitcoin for
                            its corporate treasury. Michael Saylor, the company’s founder and executive chairman,
                            tweeted Wednesday:
                            Microstrategy has increased its bitcoin holdings by ~2,500 BTC. As of 12/27/22 Microstrategy
                            holds ~132,500 bitcoin acquired for ~$4.03 billion at an average price of ~$30,397 per
                            bitcoin.
                            In its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Microstrategy
                            clarified that the 2,500 coins were acquired between Nov. 1 and Dec. 24 by its wholly owned
                            subsidiary Macrostrategy.
                            The subsidiary bought approximately 2,395 BTC at an average price of $17,871 per coin
                            between Nov. 1 and Dec. 21. It then sold about 704 BTC at $16,776 per coin on Dec. 22.
                            Macrostrategy then bought about 810 more BTC at $16,845 per coin on Dec. 24. At the time of
                            writing, bitcoin is trading at $16,656.80.
                            The bitcoin sale in December marked the first time Microstrategy sold its bitcoin since it
                            began accumulating the crypto for its corporate treasury in 2020. The company cited tax
                            reasons for selling BTC. ‘Microstrategy plans to carry back the capital losses resulting
                            from this transaction against previous capital gains, to the extent such carrybacks are
                            available under the federal income tax laws currently in effect, which may generate a tax
                            benefit,’ the SEC filing describes.
                            Saylor said in an interview last week:
                            The most positive thing of the year is the emergence of bitcoin as the institutional grade
                            digital asset and the clarity that … there is one crypto asset that’s a digital commodity …
                            Bitcoin is that commodity.
                            The executive noted that both the chairman of the SEC and the chair of the Commodity Futures
                            Trading Commission (CFTC) have confirmed that bitcoin is a commodity.
                            Saylor previously explained that Microstrategy is investing in BTC ‘for the long term.’ He
                            added: ‘Our strategy is to buy bitcoin and hold the bitcoin, so there’s no price target … I
                            expect bitcoin is going to go into the millions. So, we’re very patient. We think it’s the
                            future of money.’

                                <h1>📰 Bitcoin Miners’ Revenue Hits $9.55 Billion in 2022</h1>
                                <div>

                                    <p class="mt-3"> 2022 has been a rough and tough year for investors, traders,
                                        cryptocurrency businesses, and miners in general. The prolonged bear market,
                                        exacerbated by a series of catastrophic events, posed a threat to miners.
                                        Miners were dealing with a variety of issues, including defaulted loans,
                                        quarterly losses, and soaring bitcoin hashrates that reached all-time highs. All
                                        these factors were affecting the profitability of the miners and were causing
                                        sell pressure.
                                        The situation was aggravated when cryptocurrency prices, including Bitcoin’s,
                                        plummeted. Bitcoin, which was hovering around $48,000 last year, hit a low of
                                        $15,590 by the end of 2022. According to the data collected from The Block,
                                        bitcoin miners’ revenue hit $9.55 billion in 2022.
                                    <h5>Bitcoin miners’ revenue dropped in 2022</h5>
                                    Bitcoin, which is trading at $16,721 at press time, has been on a downward spiral
                                    alongside other cryptocurrencies. The falling cryptocurrency prices had a major
                                    effect on the income and profits of miners. Even though the $9.55 billion in revenue
                                    in 2022 seems like a large number, it is comparatively lower than that of 2021.
                                    Over the course of 2021, bitcoin miners made more than $15 billion in revenue,
                                    according to the data from the block. This was actually considered to be a 206%
                                    year-over-year increase.
